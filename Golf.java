/*This is the driver class of the program. It uses the methods of the DeckAndDiscard class and the Player class
 * to program the Golf game. The game starts by asking the players their names and then creates their boards.
 * It then asks the players to flip over two cards and the game begins. The players take turns until one of them
 * has all cards turned over and the winner is the player with the least points. A turn starts by the player choosing
 * if he wants the card on the discard pile or a new one. If the user chooses the discard pile, he gets the options to
 * either swap it with a flipped card or flip a new card. If the player chooses a new card, he gets the option to replace
 * one of the cards on the board or discard it. If he chooses to replace, he chooses between a flipped card or flip a new
 * card. If the player chooses to flip a new card, the game redisplays the board and the user gets the option again to
 * replace or toss. In the end, for transparency, the game displays the cards remaining in the deck and the ones in the
 * discard pile.
